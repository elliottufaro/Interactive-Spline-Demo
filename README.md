This project demonstrates an interactive 3D spline visualization using. The demo includes various features such as dynamic spline manipulation, noise-based transformations, and user interaction through mouse events.

Features
- Interactive Controls: Users can interact with the splines using mouse events to move control points and adjust the shape of the spline.
- Noise-Based Transformations: Apply noise functions to create hand drawn and spline movements.

Files
- index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the canvas and includes the necessary scripts for the demo.
- g.js: Contains utility functions for handling mouse events, matrix operations, and drawing operations.
- noise2.js: Contains functions for generating 2D noise.
- table.js: Handles data for control points and spline segments.
- table.txt: Provides the data structure for the control points and spline segments.
